spotify rich presence for discord


# Using 

You will need to download [this file](https://github.com/nations/spoticord/blob/master/spotify.js) and place it in the same directory as app.js.

From here you can just run 

`$ npm install`

`$ npm run start`
and it should connect.


So what's the difference, you might ask.
Well, some users have told me that spoticord struggles with ads, this on doesn't.
